Very interesting mini project.

I decided to push this to git so I have it saved if I ever wanted to hide my footsteps when I have done something bad :D .

jokes aside. don't use this code to hide your footsteps. they will probably find out you tried to do something bad :D .

but however. the thing is, this is an example or template lets say, a few python scripts that are modifying the file creating date.
we have a .py file for -> 
jpg
word
excel
pdf

script basically loads the file, and it changes its creation metadata both on the file and OS. (WORKS ONLY FOR WINDOWS)

this can serve as a some kind of template, but not nearly 100% ready. 

it was interesting to see that this is actually in my opinion a really really really hard thing to do. and it cannot be done by anyone, expecially if we are 
talking about REAL code that will actually do this stuff, not my banana code. This can be really challenging.
